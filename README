MailFeed
========

A simple script to easily pull incoming e-mails from a webserver.

E-mail is a strikingly complex protocol. Managing e-mail logins, servers, and representations takes a surprisingly large amount of work. The attached code is intended to abstract this clutter into a nice Pythonic iterator

Example: 
>>> from mailFeed import mailFeed
>>> inbox = mailFeed(username='sam', password='123', host='imap.gmail.com')

>>> for mail in inbox:
...     print mail


This code runs forever. inbox is a generator or infinite list. It will keep waiting for more e-mails to arrive so that it can process them. 


Installation
------------

This is a simple pure python script. No installation is required.
